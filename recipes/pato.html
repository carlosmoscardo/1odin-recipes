    <h2 class="title-main">Description</h2>
    <p class="plain"><strong>Magret de pato</strong> is a dish made with <strong>the breast of a duck raised for foie gras</strong>, characterized by its juicy meat and <strong>a layer of fat that browns when cooked</strong>. It is prepared by scoring the skin in a diamond pattern and cooking it over medium heat, allowing the fat to melt and form a crispy crust while the inside remains pink and tender.</p>
    <p class="plain">Once cooked, the magret is sliced thinly and is often served with sweet-and-sour sauces, such as red wine reduction, red fruits, or orange. It is a refined and tasty dish, where the balance between juicy meat and crispy skin makes it an <em>exquisite option</em> to enjoy an elegant and flavorful preparation.</p>

        <li>Season both sides of the magret with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan without oil over medium heat and place the magret skin-side down, allowing the fat to melt and the skin to become crispy.</li>
        <li>Cook for 6-8 minutes, then flip it over and sear the other side for another 3-4 minutes, until the inside is pink.</li>
        <li>Remove the magret and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it thinly.</li>
        <li>Prepare the sauce by reducing red wine, honey, red fruits, and balsamic vinegar over medium heat until you get a thick texture.</li>
        <li>Plate the dish, serving the sliced magret with the sauce on top or on the side.</li>
